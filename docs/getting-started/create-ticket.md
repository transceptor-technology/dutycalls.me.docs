# Step 4 - Create a new ticket

To check if everything is set up properly:

1. Go back to the **Sources** page and click on the **Setup** button of the source that you have just added.
2. A dialog now shows up. Click on the third tab called **New ticket** and you are ready to create a new ticket. Just fill in the required fields
3. Click on the **Create** button. If all is well, you should now see a ticket in the inbox.

> **Note:** The `title` of a ticket could be part of push notifications, emails, text messages being send by DutyCalls, which will be truncated when being too long. If you want to make sure that ticket titles are displayed correctly, stick to a maximum of `50` characters.
