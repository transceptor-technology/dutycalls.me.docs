The steps are as follows: Go back to the \"Add action\" dialog, select a tag to which you want the HTTP request and now select the Run HTTP request action type. When you click on the Configure button you will be taken to the HTTP request configurator. Here you can configure exactly the HTTP request that you want to execute when a ticket is received with the tag you specified. The first value you must provide is the HTTP method. After that, in the next screen you can specify the URL to which the request has to be sent. Then in the next screen you can specify the query parameters that you want to pass to the request. In the same way as with the query parameters, you can specify the headers you want to include in the request. By default, the header User-Agent is assigned to the request. The last step is to add a payload. A default payload is specified by default, but this can be adjusted to your liking. Then click on the Save button to save the request. Now that the HTTP request is configured, the action can be added to the specified tag. From then on, every time a ticket is received with that tag, the configured request is executed. Using template variables DutyCalls also has support for template variables. In every component of the HTTP (except the HTTP method) these variables can be used. This allows DutyCalls to 'inject' relevant data, such as ticket information, into the request prior to sending. To use template variables, you must use the {{ }} syntax. See the example below: { \"title\": \"{{ticket.title}}\", \"body\": \"{{ticket.body}}\", \"timestamp\": {{ticket.timestamp}}, \"severity\": {{ticket.severity}} } Available template variables The following variables are available to use: Variable Description Example dutycalls.version DutyCalls version. 0.13.3 ticket.sid SID of the ticket. aiBzfnJlYWN0LWZpcmViYXNlLWF1dGhlb... ticket.title Title of the ticket.
