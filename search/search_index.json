These things are thoroughly described in the following steps. Step 1 - Create a workspace What is a workspace? A workspace is a place where everything is done. As a user you have to be a member of a workspace to make use of the functionalities of DutyCalls. A workspace often represents a company or department. There are two ways of joining a workspace. You can get invited to one and you can create one yourself. How can I create a workspace? That is very simple. Just sign in to DutyCalls and select the Create workspace button. Now enter a unique name for your workspace, click on the Create button and voila. Your workspace has been created. Step 2 - Add a source After you have signed in to your workspace, you have to add a source. What is a source? A source is literally the source from where you receive tickets. It is probably the system that you want to connect to DutyCalls. You do not actually have to connect your system to DutyCalls, as it uses a REST API. But you must indicate what you are going to post. Tickets can be posted in any format and DutyCalls needs to now how it should interpret these tickets. So a source is actually a mapping between DutyCalls and another system. To add a source you have to go to the sources page, click here on the Add source button. Here you will be asked for a name and optionally for a REST API and email configuration. This depends on whether you want to post tickets with a custom format or not. In the REST API configuration you will be asked for a sample of a ticket. A sample is just an example of a ticket/message (must be valid JSON) from the system that you want to connect to DutyCalls. After pasting it, you can map all or your keys / values to the corresponding properties of a ticket within DutyCalls. As a result, DutyCalls knows how to use and display your ticket. When defining a custom format, it is not mandatory to override all properties of a ticket. It may of course be possible that, for example, you do not have to show a link in a ticket or no severity is included in a ticket. There are, however, two mandatory properties. These are: title and body . The next optional step is to configure the mail for this source. The things to enter here are valid email addresses from where emails may be sent to DutyCalls and the rules to be assigned to determine the severity of an email sent to DutyCalls. Lastly, click on the Add button and the source will be added to your workspace. Step 3 - Add a channel The next logical step is to add a channel. What is a channel? A channel can be seen as a path a ticket follows after being sent. All of the tickets from all of the sources that provide the same channel will gather here. When posting a ticket to DutyCalls, it is mandatory to provide the name of at least one channel. Users will be able to subscribe to these channels, which ensures that they will receive these tickets. To add a channel. Go to the channels page and click on the Add channel button. You will have to fill in the following information: Name: The name of the new channel. Manager: A manager is ultimately responsible person within a channel and will, among other things, receive warnings when something is wrong within a channel. Every user within a workspace can be designated as a manager of a channel. Source: By selecting the source, the channel knows from which source it must receive tickets. Minimum subscribers: A minimum number of subscribers have to be defined. If this minimum is not reached, a warning will be raised. Schedules: Schedules or rather 'ignore schedules' are used to indicate when you do not want the channel to receive tickets. This does not have to be done immediately and can always be added / adjusted at a later stage. (optional) Now click on the Add button and the new channel will be added to your workspace. Step 4 - Create a new ticket To check if everything is set up properly, go back to the sources page and click on the Setup button of the source that you have just added. A dialog now shows up. Click on the third tab called New Ticket and you are ready to create a new ticket. Just fill in the required fields and click on the Create button. If all is well, you should now see a ticket in the inbox. Note : The title of a ticket could be part of push notifications, emails, text messages being send by DutyCalls, which will be truncated when being too long. If you want to make sure that ticket titles are displayed correctly, stick to a maximum of 50 characters. Where to next? Now that you have set up your workspace, you might want to check out these resources.

Authentication All API calls require authentication. The authentication scheme we use for HTTP requests, is Basic Authentication. In every request a combination of a username and a password must be provided. When manually sending an HTTP request to our API, the following header is required: Authorization: Basic $CREDENTIALS . Where $CREDENTIALS is a base64-encoded string of username:password . You can find these credentials by: Going to the sources page in your workspace. Clicking on the Setup button of the relevant source. Verifying that you are authorized to access these credentials. Copying the relevant credentials from the setup dialog. Important : You should store your credentials in a secure location. It is important to keep your credentials confidential to protect your account. Example In addition to the credentials and the data itself, the name or names of the targeted channels must also be included in the HTTP request. These must be added as the value of the query parameter channel in the URI of the request. An example of this can be seen below. curl -X POST \"https://dutycalls.me/api/ticket?channel=$CHANNEL_NAME\" -H \"accept: application/json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"Authorization: Basic $CREDENTIALS\" -d { \"title\": \"This is the title of the ticket\", \"body\": \"This is the body of the ticket\", \"severity\": \"medium\" } Note : The keys and values of the JSON to be sent, must exactly match the source configuration.
